# My Awesome Project
Have you ever been stuck on deciding what to make for lunch / dinner?
This is a web application that allows users to input an ingredient they desire and generates recipes from the EDAMAM API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

This project was built using the create react app. The data is fetched from EDAMAM's API, multiple states were included, and useEffect method was implemented. The css displays a clean and simple user interface that is also responsive. 

## Optimizations

Optimizations for the future include implementing hover effects to buttons, routes to pages of the recipe, and allow use of multiple ingredients at once.

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

The lessons learned in this project proved to be valuable. I was successful in obtaining a better understanding of the benefits component based UI's provide to an engineer, got hands on experience using state and useEffect, as well as learning to apply module.css to a component.
